# Example of Kotlin for Android app development

## Libraries used:
- Retrofit 2.0: To consume public Reddit API.
- RxJava(RxAndroid): We will use Observables to decouple the UI thread with our background tasks. In this case to call the API and return this values to the UI.
- Picasso: Load images from Reddit.
- RecyclerView: We will use the RecyclerView to present the information and also to provide the infinite scroll behaviour.
- Dagger 2: Dependency Injection
- Kotlin Android Extensions: to bind the UI (Views) with code.
- Version Control
